VFS assignement
===
##The assignement
The goal of this assignement is to create a Virtual File System (VFS) management program in Java.
Two main parts should be implemented :

* the VFS core, responsible for creating, opening and deleting VFS disk files, but also for creating, moving, copying, importing, exporting, deleting files and folders, and finally allowing the user to explore and see the hierarchy of the VFS.
* the VFS command line, an easier way for the user to use the VFS. (*TODO*)

##About us
We are two students in second year in Centrale Paris engineering school. This assignement was made for our Software Engineering course, given by P. Ballarini.
